# Random Priority Raffle

This program implements the **Random Priority** algorithm for assigning `n` objects to `n` participants in a way that is [fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_random_assignment) (equal treatment of equals) and [strategyproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategyproofness) (participants cannot "game the system").

## How it works

Rules:

- Each participant will be assigned exactly one "prize"
- Participants must specify which prizes they prefer (most preferred to least preferred)
- There can be multiple "copies" of the same prize
- Participants are allowed multiple "entries" in the drawing, to improve likelihood of receiving a more preferred prize

Algorithm:

1. Draw a participant at random from the list of entries. If that participant already has a prize, draw again.
2. If their first preference prize is still available, assign it to that participant. Otherwise, continue down their preference list until an available prize is found (second preference, third preference, etc.)
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 until all participants have been assigned a prize

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a YAML configuration file with input parameters (see [config.sample.yaml](./config.sample.yaml) as an example)
4. Run `./random-priority-raffle.py <CONFIG_FILE_PATH>`
