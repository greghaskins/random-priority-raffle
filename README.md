# Random Priority Raffle

This program implements the **Random Priority** algorithm for assigning `n` objects to `n` participants in a way that is [fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_random_assignment) (equal treatment of equals) and [strategyproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategyproofness) (participants cannot "game the system").
